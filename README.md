### 3.1 You need to buy
Nothing, this is all free! 

### 3.2 How do I know that I set up the  correctly
Follow instructions in the docs of the website above, and try to watch a video on the stream details page on your iOS and Android device. If the notification goes through, you're in business.

### 3.3 Important things to note
* You can ACTUALLY play the video from the app because I implement a seamless webview that contains the Youtube video embedded
* I used a Feed reader rather than the straight forward isntructions here https://www.thewissen.io/embedding-youtube-feed-xamarin-forms/ so that I wouldnt have to share API keys, but you are more than welcome to do that one. But you'd still need to use a webview to actually play one of those videos
